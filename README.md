# Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics - University of Bucharest -  Master Data Science
Here are some projects done for my Data Science Master's program:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/AndreiCuculescu/master-DataScience/tree/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/AndreiCuculescu/master-DataScience/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing)
- [Practical Machine Learning](https://github.com/AndreiCuculescu/master-DataScience/tree/main/Practical%20Machine%20Learning)
- [Big Data](https://github.com/AndreiCuculescu/master-DataScience/tree/main/Big%20Data)

I mainly used supervised algorithms, but I also used unsupervised algorithms as well as dimensionality reduction algorithms. 
In the case of the NLP project I also used word embedding techniques which are used to represent the words mathematically.
