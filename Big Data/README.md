# Big Data

Big Data project on Rain in Australia dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).

The purpose of this project was to compare how dimensionality reduction affect model performance and execution time on whether it will rain tomorrow or not.
We used more dimensionality reduction algorithms:
- Principal Component Analysis
- SVD
- Random Forest Built-in Feature Importance

And we used 4 supervised algorithms:
- Logistic regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
