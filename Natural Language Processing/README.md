# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing for the Clickbait Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/clickbait-dataset).

For this assignment we have tried to classify the headlines as clickbait or not. We have used different NLP techniques (TFIDF, Word2vec, NLTK)  on our texts, and 5 classification methods to see which would perform better. We have tried both with and without preprocessing the texts and we also have done some data visualization.

Methods used:
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging Classifier

Word Embedding Techniques used:
- TF-IDF
- Word2Vec
