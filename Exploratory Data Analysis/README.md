# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis for Employee Future Prediction dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/employee-future-prediction). 

7 supervised models were applied and their obtained accuracy and precision was compared.

Models used:  
- Logistic Regression 
- K-nearest neighbors
- Support vector machine
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
- Bagging Classifier


The model with the best Accuracy is Bagging Classifier, followed by Decision Tree Classifier. 

Models with the best Precision are Bagging Classifier, followed by Random Forest Classifier.

As an average of both quite good Accuracy and Classifier, Bagging Classifier performed good.
