# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis for Employee Future Prediction dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/employee-future-prediction). 

7 supervised methods were applied and their obtained accuracy and precision were compared to obtain that:

- The model with the best Accuracy is Bagging Classifier, followed by Decision Tree Classifier.
- Models with the best Precision are Bagging Classifier, followed by Random Forest Classifier.
- As an average of both quite good Accuracy and Precision , Bagging Classifier performed good.

Methods used:  
- Logistic Regression 
- K-nearest neighbors
- Support vector machine
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
